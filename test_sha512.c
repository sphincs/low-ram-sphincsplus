/*
 * This tests out the SHA512 primitive
 *
 * Obvious question: why do we have a test for the SHA-512 primitive,
 * but not the SHA-256 or SHAKE primitives?  Well, the answer is due to
 * historic reasons; the SHA-256 and SHAKE primitives were implemented
 * before the regression tests (and hence because we passed the Sphincs+
 * KATs, obviously we must have gotten those two correct).  In contrast,
 * our SHA-512 implementation was done after the regression test
 * infratructure was done - this test is here to make sure that we did
 * SHA-512 correctly (so we didn't waste time trying to figure out why
 * Sphincs+ KATs failed).
 *
 * And, once these tests were there (and passed), there was no urgent
 * reason to remove them.
